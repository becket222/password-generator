05 Advanced JavaScript Module: Password Generator Challenge 

## Description 
Creating an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. The app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. The user interface is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria 
Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
 1. Length of password - at least 8 characters but no more than 128.
 2. Character types - lowercase (abc), uppercase (ABC), numeric (123), special characters ($@%&*).

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

The application should not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.

Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

## Code Improvements
