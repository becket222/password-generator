## Acceptance Criteria 
Generate a password when the button is clicked.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
 1. Length of password - at least 8 characters but no more than 128.
 2. Character types - lowercase (abc), uppercase (ABC), numeric (123), special characters ($@%&*).

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

The application should not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.

Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

## Code Improvements 
Apllication's JavaScript file is properly commented.
